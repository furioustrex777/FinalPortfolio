Thousands of\n            websites are developed everyday, wanting to share their ideas and\n            provide a service, similar to that of start-up, with some overlap as\n            well.\n          </p>\n          <div id=\"ogwebsite\">\n            <img class=\"ogwebsite\" src={develop}></img>\n          </div>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <a\n              id=\"toBakery\"\n              href=\"https://furioustrex777.github.io/development/\"\n            >\n              Click here to visit the deployed page\n            </a>\n          </div>\n\n          {/* <p>\n            This is Thai Food Connection's website that displays their menu\n            items and allows people to order food online.\n          </p> */}\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Architecture and Features</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"columns\">\n          <div class=\"column\">\n            <h3 style={{ textAlign: \"center\", color: \"#49565b\" }}>Filtering</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li style={{ padding: \"0\", color: \"#49565b\" }}>\n                For the list of bakery goods, you're able to filter on two\n                different fields with six options in total.

Additionally,\n          important nutritional information is provided such as calories and\n          dietary restrictions. Having easy access to this information, as well\n          as being able to favorite items and find them all at once easily adds\n          great value to users, saving time and effort looking for this\n          information on their own.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          <h3>How I Developed the Application</h3>\n          For this implementation, I only had one component, a BakeryItem\n          component, that holds of the information of the bakery item. This\n          includes the image, name, description, price, calories,\n          dietary-restrictions, and the type of the bakery item. The main props\n          that were used consisted of the items themselves, in order to\n          information stored in them. Additionally, the string variables, I\n          called name, were used in order to determine the functionality of\n          buttons, as different buttons did different things to the display\n          lists through sorting and filtering of different catagories. In this\n          implementation, I had six states. I had an options states, that acted\n          as the list that displayed the items depending on the sorting,\n          filtering, and if applicable, favoriting. I then had filters and\n          filtersDiet lists that held what filters were active. I then had a\n          sorted state that held what sort method would be maintained throughout\n          the manipulation of the options(display) list, and what to default to\n          if there are no items in the combinations of filters. Finally, I have\n          a favs list that holds all the favorited items, and a favorite\n          boolean, allowing me two determine if a different functionality is\n          needed if you are looking at your favorites or not.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          <h3>Designing the Application</h3>\n          Because people after look at the screen from left to right, we placed\n          the filtering and sorting options on the left, creating a better\n          hierarchy for the overall web-app. I then ordered those options in\n          order of most likely to be used, while allowing those options to all\n          to remain visible throughout the whole process. For the BakeryItem\n          component, I also layed this out from left to right. I then\n          centralized the more important information such as price and calories,\n          and these values would stay in the same location no matter what\n          helping with learnability in addition to better usability. This is\n          accompanyed by an easy access to the favorite aggregate feature and\n          with clear knowledge of if it is in the aggregator or not. Finally the\n          BakeryItem were stacked into a scrollable list allowing multiple items\n          to be seen along with the filtering and sorting options helping to\n          improve usability\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <div>\n          <h1>Conculusions and Thoughts</h1>\n          <p>\n            Working with react, we got to implement our coding knowledge,\n            creating functions to provide functionality to the buttons on the\n            page. Although not required, I wanted to make this page the best it\n            could be, in design and functionality. All the functionality works\n            no matter the combination of sorting, filtering, or aggergating.\n            Additionally, I explored CSS aspects to make the buttons visibly\n            buttons, adding hovering and before and after affects. I had a lot\n            of fun with this assignment as there was a lot of freedom in how we\n            could approach this project, and I felt that because of that it was\n            a greater learning experience.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Develop;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,gBAAgB;AAAC;AAExB,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAG,MAAM;EACpB;EACA,IAAIC,OAAO,GAAGC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,mBAAmB;EAChE,IAAIC,YAAY,GAAGH,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,yBAAyB;EAC3E,IAAIE,SAAS,GAAGJ,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,sBAAsB;EACrE,IAAIG,SAAS,GAAGL,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,sBAAsB;EACrE,IAAII,OAAO,GAAGN,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,oBAAoB;EACjE,IAAIK,QAAQ,GAAGP,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,qBAAqB;EACnE,IAAIM,QAAQ,GAAGR,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,qBAAqB;EACnE,IAAIO,OAAO,GAAGT,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,oBAAoB;EACjE,IAAIQ,UAAU,GAAGV,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,uBAAuB;EAEvE,oBACE;IAAK,EAAE,EAAC,gBAAgB;IAAA,wBACtB;MAAA,uBACE;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAoB,eAKpB;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAYI,eACJ;UAAK,EAAE,EAAC,WAAW;UAAA,uBACjB;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,WAAW;YAAC,GAAG,EAAEH;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAO;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACvC,eACN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEY,SAAS,EAAE;UAAS,CAAE;UAAA,uBAClC;YACE,EAAE,EAAC,UAAU;YACb,IAAI,EAAC,+CAA+C;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAGlD;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IAMF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eAEV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAkC,eAElC;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,wBAClB;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAA,wBACjB;YAAI,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEA,SAAS,EAAE,QAAQ;cAAEC,KAAK,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAe,eACpE;YAAA,wBACE;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAIzC,eACL;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGzC,eACL;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGzC;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACD,eACN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAA,wBACjB;YAAI,KAAK,EAAE;cAAED,SAAS,EAAE,QAAQ;cAAEC,KAAK,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAa,eAClE;YAAA,wBACE;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGzC,eACL;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGzC;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACD,eACN;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAA,wBACjB;YAAI,KAAK,EAAE;cAAED,SAAS,EAAE,QAAQ;cAAEC,KAAK,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAEhD,eACL;YAAA,wBACE;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAIzC,eACL;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAIzC,eACL;cAAI,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG;gBAAED,KAAK,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAIzC;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACD;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eAEV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA4B,eAE5B;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAwB,eACxB;QAAA,qcAQE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAS,eACT;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAS,eACT;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAwC,6uCAoBxC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAS,eACT;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAS,eACT;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAkC;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAehC;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACI,eACV;MAAA,uBACE;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAkC,eAClC;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAWI;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACN;AAEV,CAAC;AAAC,KAzLId,OAAO;AA2Lb,eAAeA,OAAO;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
