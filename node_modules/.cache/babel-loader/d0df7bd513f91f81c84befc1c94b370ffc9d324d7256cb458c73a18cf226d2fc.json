Continuing\n          the theme of frustrated, I constructed a scenario where on of the\n          personas above, Susan, encountered a frustrating experience with the\n          interface.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centering\">\n          <p>\n            <img\n              class=\"StoryBoard\"\n              src={image3}\n              alt=\"annotated sketch of projector\"\n            ></img>\n            <p style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n              This storyboard is for Susan Sugandee, who's goal is to be the\n              best HTA that she can be. However, due to many commitments, she\n              tends to rush through her tasks. She has had little time to\n              prepare, but goes into class with a presentation. She see she has\n              many options to present, and tries the easiest and most familiar\n              option. However, this does not work which makes her frustrated as\n              this had worked before, but she tries another method rahter than\n              waste time. Luckily there was a bit of guidance that allowed her\n              to successfully project her computer screen. This persona did not\n              want to waste her student's time and wanted to perform her duties\n              correctly. This storyboard reflects how the interface can be\n              confusing and not work as expected at times, and can be\n              frustrating at times.\n            </p>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <div>\n          <h1>Conculusions and Thoughts</h1>\n          <p>\n            Overall this was a knowledgable experience. I learned the\n            foundations of learnability, usability, and memorability. It was\n            interesting to think of physical object such as this projection\n            console and things like microwaves as interfaces, similar to that of\n            a webpage. I deepened my knowledge of the frustration that can come\n            across with a bad user interface and as a result a bad user\n            experience. This project had helped to understand potential\n            downfalls that an interface can have, knowledge I can utilize for\n            later projects. Overall, this class user experience task was\n            helpfull in kick-starting my abilities as a webpage developer.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n
