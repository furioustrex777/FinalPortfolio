It is used by many to project\n            their screens, to show presentations, videos, and many more things.\n            This interface aims to simplify the complex steps it would take to\n            set up a room for a screen projection, as each object such as the\n            lights and shades have their own set of controls. There are many\n            buttons on a projector and around the room that have been\n            consolidated into this one interface!\n            <br></br>\n            The inital page is for fast and easy operations, with common fuction\n            in the utility bar to the right of the screen.\n            <br></br>\n            Then there is an advance page that brings you to a series of other\n            page to have more custimzation and control over the room.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <h2>Key Observations:</h2>\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            Preface: We observed different users who used the projection console\n            throughout Brown University buildings. We were able to observe\n            professors, teaching assistants, and student to provide a sample\n            that represented different ages, jobs, nationalities and\n            socioeconomic demographics since Brown's population is diverse.\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                As people worked with the interface, they initally looked at the\n                screen for a bit of time, before continuing with their task.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Most users connected the projector with the HDMI cord and this\n                worked about 75% of the time but when users ran into issues this\n                with cord, users would default to AirMedia.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Some people utilized the advanced screen to control the screen,\n                lights, and shades in the room.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Most people often seemed to make a confused face at time while\n                interacting with the interface.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Many users tapped the screen multiple times if it didn't respond\n                quickly.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <h2>Questions and Responses:</h2>\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            {/* <ol>\n              <li> */}\n            How would you describe the process of projecting your screen?\n            {/* </li>\n              <ul>\n                <li> */}\n            I expected a more automatic process, as the interface itself was not\n            self explanatory making it hard to learn and find things that are\n            needed, which made using the interface complicated to use as there\n            was not one clear way to do the task.\n            {/* </li>\n              </ul>\n              <li> */}\n            Could you craft an idea of what you should do next at each step?\n            {/* </li>\n              <ul>\n                <li> */}\n            It was not clear what should be done next at each step, and I made\n            assumptions as labeling was weird and unclear, and both the simple\n            and busy screens lead to exploration which distracted me from the\n            task.\n            {/* </li>\n              </ul> */}\n            {/* <li> */}\n            Did you expect things to go the way at each step?\n            {/* </li> */}\n            {/* <ul>\n                <li> */}\n            Yes and no, there was no help when things go awry and there were too\n            many options, making controls like video routing to be more\n            confusing, but I would say that I needed the advanced options as\n            basic was too basic.\n            {/* </li>\n              </ul>\n              <li> */}\n            How did you learn to use the interface?

However, due to many commitments, she\n              tends to rush through her tasks. She has had little time to\n              prepare, but goes into class with a presentation. She see she has\n              many options to present, and tries the easiest and most familiar\n              option. However, this does not work which makes her frustrated as\n              this had worked before, but she tries another method rahter than\n              waste time. Luckily there was a bit of guidance that allowed her\n              to successfully project her computer screen. This persona did not\n              want to waste her student's time and wanted to perform her duties\n              correctly. This storyboard reflects how the interface can be\n              confusing and not work as expected at times, and can be\n              frustrating at times.\n            </p>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Personas;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,gBAAgB;AAAC;AAExB,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG,MAAM;EACrB;EACA,IAAIC,KAAK,GAAGC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAACC,UAAU,GAAG,GAAG,GAAG,8BAA8B;EACzE,oBACE;IAAA,wBACE;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,EAAE,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAAA,wBACtB;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAmC,eACnC;UAAA,uCACa;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACjB,eACL;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAUI;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA0D,eAC1D;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAoBI;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACI,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA0B,eAC1B;QAAA,wBACE;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;UACpB,GAAG,EAAEH,KAAM;UACX,GAAG,EAAC;QAA+B;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAC9B,eACP;UAAA,4gBASE;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS,sIAGT;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAGP;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA0B,eAC1B;QAAA,uBACE;UAAA,yVAME;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGK,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAIK,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGK,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGK,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGK;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MACH;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAiC,eACjC;QAAA,uBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MA2DI;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAsB,eACtB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAGI,eACJ;QAAA,uBACE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MAEI;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAoB,eACpB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAII,eACJ;QAAA,uBACE;UAAA,uBAEE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAcI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MACF;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACN;AAEV,CAAC;AAAC,KAxNID,QAAQ;AA0Nd,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
