However, due to many commitments, she\n              tends to rush through her tasks. She has had little time to\n              prepare, but goes into class with a presentation. She see she has\n              many options to present, and tries the easiest and most familiar\n              option. However, this does not work which makes her frustrated as\n              this had worked before, but she tries another method rahter than\n              waste time. Luckily there was a bit of guidance that allowed her\n              to successfully project her computer screen. This persona did not\n              want to waste her student's time and wanted to perform her duties\n              correctly. This storyboard reflects how the interface can be\n              confusing and not work as expected at times, and can be\n              frustrating at times.\n            </p>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>{\" \"}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Personas;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAAC;AAE1B,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG,MAAM;EACrB,oBACE;IAAA,wBACE;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,EAAE,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAAA,wBACtB;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAmC,eACnC;UAAA,uCACa;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACjB,eACL;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAUI;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAA0D,eAC1D;MAAA,uBACE;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAGK,eACL;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAGK,eACL;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAGK,eACL;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAGK,eACL;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAsE;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACnE;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACH,eACJ;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA0B,eAC1B;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,qBAAqB;QAAA,uBAE9B;UAAA,4gBASE;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS,eACT;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS,sIAGT;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAS;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MAGP;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAA0B,eAC1B;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,qBAAqB;QAAA,uBAC9B;UAAA,yVAME;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGK,eACL;cAAA,WACG,GAAG;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAID,eACL;cAAA,WACG,GAAG;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGD,eACL;cAAA,WACG,GAAG;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGD,eACL;cAAA,WACG,GAAG;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGD;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MACH;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAiC,eACjC;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,qBAAqB;QAAA,uBAC9B;UAAA,uBACE;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAEK,eACL;cAAA,uBACE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA;YAMK;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QACF,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAEK,eACL;cAAA,uBACE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA;YAKK;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QACF,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAA0D,eAC1D;cAAA,uBACE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA;YAKK;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QACF,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAGK,eACL;cAAA,uBACE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA;YAKK;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QACF,eACL;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAEK,eACL;cAAA,uBACE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA;YAMK;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QACF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QACF;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MACH;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,eACV;MAAA,wBACE;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAoB,eACpB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAII,eACJ;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,qBAAqB;QAAA,uBAC9B;UAAA,uBAEE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAcI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MACF;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACE,EAAC,GAAG;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACV;AAEV,CAAC;AAAC,KAzMIA,QAAQ;AA2Md,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
