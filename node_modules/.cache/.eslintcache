I discovered\n            and played around with things such as flex-box and hover aspects of\n            CSS. Throughout the development, I got to experience a lot of\n            stuggle and success, but it was a fruitful experience in which made\n            me more confident in my ability to make webpages. I received valid\n            feedback and saw how there are always exisited differing options but\n            if the goal was there, it was okay. I wanted to emphasize usuablity\n            and memorability, and I believe I accomplished just that.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <div
