Additionally, having a storyboard helps to determine how\n            usuable, learnable, and memorable our interfaces can be. This was a\n            stepping stone to becoming a good webpage developer.\n            We can think of interfaces in many different ways, and we can use this classic user experience task to\n            determine and cater our design and functionality to that of our\n            users. \n          </h1> */}\n          {/* \n          <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>\n\n          <h1 style={{ color: \"black\" }} className=\"popuptext\">\n            Continuing along our journey to be web developers, we took a look at\n            existing websites and we analyzed the page to see how it could be\n            improve.

In order to accomplish our goal of\n            making this interface match the goals of Rever, we found our final\n            prototype to be quite different from our original sketchings. We\n            needed a balance of hierarchy, simplicity, and natural flow as we\n            learned from a current Figma employee. Based on the results of the\n            user testing, we believe we did accomplish our goal as the start-up\n            liked our prototype, and we realized how we could constantly improve\n
