        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Approximately 305 million start-ups are created annually. In this
            project we aimed to mock up a solution to a start-ups concept. In
            hopes of achieving this goal, we have created a mobile interactive
            interface for Rever, an app for making returns. Our group designed
            an interactive prototype for this start-up with only the concept of
            fast returns as our foundations. This process involved sketching
            ideas of the interface to creating an interactive high-fidelity
            prototype, to conducting user testing on a critiqued prototype. We
            then contacted the startup to share our prototype with them.

        <h3 style={{ color: "#49565B" }}>Context about the startup:</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Rever is an up and coming startup with the goal of making returns
            easier. Rever makes returns easier by consolidating returns into one
            location and allowing consumers to return their products in 2
            clicks. By offering different refund methods, you can get an instant
            refund if you need it rather than waiting for the long process of
            the return.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>
          What type of users are impacted by our interface and why would they be
          impacted?
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Our interface mainly impacts small to medium sized businesses that
            work in sales, as well as consumers of all ages and socioeconomic
            statuses, as this service provides an ease of life experience.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Users, both customers and businesses, can easily manage
            refunds with mobile phones. Users can sign in as a customer or
            business on the login page. Customers can select returnable items
            they would like to return in one click and have an option for
            instant refund, full refund, and refund through store credit.
            Businesses can manage all refunds from all customers in one page and
            can visualize refunds completed, in-progress, and canceled. The
            simple interface makes it more accessible, enhancing memorability.

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          In a group of four we brainstorming solutions through sketches and
          lofi wireframes, to explore different design ideas on how to highlight
          key concepts of the application. This was vital in developing our
          ideas, taking into consideration alternative designs and not commiting
          to a singular idea early on.

        <p>
          After discussing and consolidating our ideas, we came up with the

          start-up:
          {/* After sketching, we regrouped and discussed
          whether our sketches were effective at solving the problem and diverse
          or creative. We then combined our ideas into a single wireframe that
          we created in Figma. */}
          {/* and to consolidate what we thought would be a
          good design to match the goals of the start-up, a quick and easy
          process */}

        <h3>Overall Task</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Return the Air Jordan 1s from Nike. Choose any refund option that
            you'd like.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Subtasks</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            1. You are a busy and stressed customer with a shopping history and
            want to make quick returns. On the login screen, sign in as a
            customer. *in this mockup, you do not need to actually fill in the
            email and password input spaces.
            <br></br>2. You've recently initiated a refund on a MacBook and you
            want to check on how the refund is going. From the home page, find
            the purchase/refund information for the MacBook to see if it has
            been received by the business!
            <br></br>3. Return the pair of jeans for an Instant Refund, they
            donâ€™t fit and you need a new pair ASAP.
            <br></br>4. It turns out youâ€™re also a business owner who's hoping
            to easily keep track of refunds. Sign out of your customer profile
            and log in again, but this time from the Business option. *again,
            you do not need to actually fill in the email and password input
            spaces.
            <br></br>5. You want to review only the refunds in progress right
            now. Luckily, you notice that you can filter your options from the
            top menu bar. Filter the dashboard so that you only see the refunds
            that are IN PROGRESS, and click on one of them to see more
            information on how the refund is going.

          <p>
            All users were given the same task of returning the Air Jordan with
            some subtasks listed above. Users reported that refund options were
            easily understandable and that locating items were easy too. All
            users agreed that grouping and sorting the items and orders made the
            interface more usable and accessible. All users prioritized speed
            over precision, which is in line with the startup's mission and our
            prototype's goal (to make refunds quicker and easier). Even the
            business profile seemed intuitive to the users, too, as they all
            completed the subtasks successfully and stated that "the color
            coding for status and ability to filter made it easier." Although
            there seemed to be soem confusion about the sign-in page and the
            meaning of icons, overall the UserTesting went as expected as all
            users completed the task without much difficulty.

          <p>
            In conclusion, through the iterative design process, we learned alot
            about the importance of feedback. In order to accomplish our goal of
            making this interface match the goals of Rever, we found our final
            prototype to be quite different from our original sketchings. We
            needed a balance of hierarchy, simplicity, and natural flow as we
            learned from a current Figma employee. Based on the results of the
            user testing, we believe we did accomplish our goal as the start-up
            liked our prototype, and we realized how we could constantly improve
            upon our design.
