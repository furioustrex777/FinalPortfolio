        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Approximately 305 million start-ups are created annually. In this
            project we aimed to mock up a solution to a start-ups concept. In
            hopes of achieving this goal, we have created a mobile interactive
            interface for Rever, an app for making returns. Our group designed
            an interactive prototype for this start-up with only the concept of
            fast returns as our foundations. This process involved sketching
            ideas of the interface to creating an interactive high-fidelity
            prototype, to conducting user testing on a critiqued prototype. We
            then contacted the startup to share our prototype with them.

              Context about the startup:
            </h3>
            Rever is an up and coming startup with the goal of making returns
            easier. Rever makes returns easier by consolidating returns into one
            location and allowing consumers to return their products in 2
            clicks. By offering different refund methods, you can get an instant
            refund if you need it rather than waiting for the long process of
            the return.
          </p>

              Interface Audience Goal
            </h3>
            Our interface mainly impacts small to medium sized businesses that
            work in sales, as well as consumers of all ages and socioeconomic
            statuses, as this service provides an ease of life experience.

              Customers
            </h3>
            Customers would want an easy and fast refund process with their
            mobile phones. Customers can select items they would like to return,
            and in one click have three options for returns: instant refund,
            full refund, and refund through store credit, making this process
            only three clicks.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

              Businesses
            </h3>
            Businesses can manage all refunds from all customers in one page and
            can visualize refunds completed, in-progress, and canceled. The
            simple interface makes it more accessible, enhancing memorability,
            while still having all the required information present.

          </h3>
          In a group of four, we brainstormed different solutions through
          sketches and lofi wireframes, to explore different design concepts on
          how to highlight key concepts of the application. This was vital in
          developing our ideas, taking into consideration alternative designs
          and not commiting to a singular idea early on.

              <li style={{ padding: "0", color: "#49565b" }}>
                All users agreed that grouping and sorting the items and orders

                Even the business profile seemed intuitive to the users, too, as
                they all completed the subtasks successfully and stated that
                "the color coding for status and ability to filter made it

          <p>
            In conclusion, through the iterative design process, we learned alot
            about the importance of feedback. In order to accomplish our goal of
            making this interface match the goals of Rever, we found our final
            prototype to be quite different from our original sketchings. We
            needed a balance of hierarchy, simplicity, and natural flow as we
            learned from a current Figma employee. Based on the results of the
            user testing, we believe we did accomplish our goal as the start-up
            liked our prototype, and we realized how we could constantly improve
            upon our design.
